# Exploring-Knowledge-Graph-for-disease-symptoms-prediction-using-Embeddings

This project focuses on developing a robust disease-symptom prediction system leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) and embeddings-based approaches. By harnessing the power of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the goal is to accurately predict diseases based on reported symptoms and vice-versa, facilitating early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.

Key Techniques:
Knowledge Graphs: Structured representations of entities (diseases, symptoms) and their relationships.
Graph Traversal: Navigating the knowledge graph to explore connected symptoms for a given disease.
Node Embeddings (e.g., Node2Vec): Dense vector representations of nodes that capture semantic similarity within the graph.
Cosine Similarity: Measuring the similarity between symptom and disease embeddings for prediction.
