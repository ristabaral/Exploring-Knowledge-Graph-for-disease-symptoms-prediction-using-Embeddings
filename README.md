# Exploring-Knowledge-Graph-for-disease-symptoms-prediction-using-Embeddings

This project focuses on developing a robust disease-symptom prediction system leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) and embeddings-based approaches. By harnessing the power of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the goal is to accurately predict diseases based on reported symptoms, facilitating early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
